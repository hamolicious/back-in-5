# Back in 5

Display a "back in 5" message over your `tmux` session.

> You are sharing your screen, pairing and your partner has to step out for a moment.
> You decide to use the moment to fetch yourself another coffee.

Now obviously the sensible thing to do here is to ~~message them and let them know you're going to fetch a coffee~~ leave a message on your screen for them to stumble on.

## Installation

Add to `.tmux.conf` with TPM:

```tmux
set -g @plugin 'hamolicious/back-in-5'
```

## Usage

Once installed and `tmux` enviornment reloaded. Simply use `<prefix>b`.
